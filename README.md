# instruct.ai — Milestone 2 Prototype

**Project:** CourseGuide AI  
**Course:** CEN 4930 — AI Agent Studio, Fall 2026  
**Institution:** Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU)

A real, running prototype of an instructor-configurable AI learning agent. The agent helps students reason through course-specific assignments without simply producing graded answers. It applies agent fundamentals, prompt engineering, tool integration, and MCP from Chapters 1–3.

## Problem

College students in reasoning-intensive courses increasingly have access to immediate general-purpose AI assistance, but that assistance is not automatically aligned with an instructor's course context, permitted help level, or expected reasoning process.

## What this agent does

- Takes a `course_id` and a student question.
- Uses an MCP tool to classify the help request (concept, hint, setup check, analogy).
- Uses an MCP tool to look up the instructor-defined course policy.
- Generates a guided, course-aligned response that respects the policy's boundaries.

## MCP tools integrated

- `lookup_course_policy(course_id)` — returns allowed help levels, forbidden help levels, tone, and style rules.
- `classify_help_request(question)` — classifies the student's request into a help type.
- `list_available_courses()` — lists configured course policies.

## Setup

The tested setup uses the OpenAI API and the `gpt-4o-mini` model. Store the private API key only in a local `.env` file.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows PowerShell, activate it with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Create `.env` in the project root:

```text
MODEL_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
BYOM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
```

Do not commit or share the API key. The MCP server starts automatically.

## Run the agent

```bash
python -m src.m2_agent --course physics_101 --question "What is velocity?"
```

On Linux/macOS, the helper script runs an example question:

```bash
bash scripts/run_m2.sh
```

## Run tests

```bash
bash scripts/run_tests.sh
```

On Windows PowerShell, run `pytest tests -v`. The tests call the live model and check five prompts for expected keywords, so valid credentials are required.

## Intentionally not implemented

The prototype does not yet retrieve syllabi, inspect images or handwritten work, or connect to Canvas. YAML files provide course policies, not syllabus content.

## Known limitations

1. The agent does not yet inspect images or handwritten work.
2. Policy matching is exact; partial course names fall back to a generic policy.
3. Help classification is keyword-based; nuanced prompts may be mislabeled.
4. Responses depend on the availability and permissions of the configured model endpoint.
